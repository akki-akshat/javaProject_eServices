    b. Added Location Deletation Feature
    c. Added Service Deletation Feature
2. Oreder can not be made for passed time.
3. UI changes for enhanced usage
4. Created multiple diagrams which are present in the PPT (E-Services_All_Diagrams.pptx) for a better understanding of the product as well as the code.

Code is already avaibale and running in a remote server: 
https://java-e-services.herokuapp.com/

P.S. :  We are using a free server so sometimes, it may take 30 seconds to start, but after that it'll work perfectly

To logins admin, the following URl can be used: https://java-e-services.herokuapp.com/adminLogin
Credentials for Admin: username: admin & password: admin
